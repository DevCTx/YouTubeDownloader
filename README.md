### YouTube Downloader developed in Python during my online class with [www.CodeAvecJonathan.com](https://codeavecjonathan.com/)

# Needs the ffmpeg audio/video codecs installed on your system : https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created.
https://ffmpeg.org/

# and the useful ffmpeg-python module from https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python
FFmpeg is extremely powerful, but its command-line interface gets really complicated rather quickly.
If you're like me and find Python to be powerful and readable, it's easier with ffmpeg-python.
